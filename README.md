# LeetCode Solutions

Only to track what I've learned and practiced over time, without needing to pay for premium features to do so. ðŸ˜œ

Lots of unclean code, some solutions definitely could be improved, but this repo is more about tracking how I approached problems and seeing other ways they could be tackled.

Using the [LeetCode Save Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mojbjmadgddjbhokmpgnceiplpdkaodj) to easily export and upload my submissions here.
